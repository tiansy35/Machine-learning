# Machine learning
 
Python code for course assignments on machine learning algorithms and their applications. 

**1. Decision Trees** 
   - Theory: data processing, CART, pruning, cross validation
   - Application: diabetes diagnosis, using data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) [[link](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overview.aspx?BeginYear=2013)]  

**2. Linear Regression** 
   - Theory: gradient descent, regularization, feature transformation, polynomial regression
   - Application: house price prediction, using data from the Ames Housing dataset [[link](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf)]

**3. Logistic Regression**
   - Theory: log loss, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad
   - Application: medical diagnosis, using data from the UCI machine learning repository, such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset [[link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)] and the diabetic retinopathy dataset [[link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set)]

**4. SVM, Emsemble Methods**
   - Theory: support vector machines (hinge loss, support vectors, kernel method), boosting, Adaboost
   - Application: equipment (chocolate pipe) failure prediction, data from [[link1](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/spring2020/homework/ChocolatePipes_trainData.csv), [link2](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/spring2020/homework/ChocolatePipes_trainLabels.csv)]
